1) Install MAMP. 
2) Follow https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPHQy22-2FE video to create the “hello” project. 
3) Modify the “hello” project and create the “search’ project. 

Hello Project: 

1) html page has the layout of the web page. And it links to both the jquery library and the project’s javascript file. 
2) lib folder contains the jQuery library .js file.
3) js folder contains the App.js file. The getData() function takes in a string and post it to the php file. After getting the data back from the php file, it display it on html content. 
4) php folder contains the script.php file. Once it get the request from .js, it connects to the database and query the data. Then, it send the result back to .js. 

Search Project: 
I created a new little database with school name, school ranking and school description. I modify the code in Hello project so that it could display school information instead. 

Todo: 
1) Create a dropDown menu from the database to populate the school names. (let the users choose from the menu).
2) Pass the user’s selection from html -> .js -> php -> database to display school information on demand. 
3) Enable scoring for each school. (dynamically calculate the average).
4) Move the server & database from localhost to cloud.
